## Experience

#### Rutgers University (Lab Manager, 2023/11 - present) 

* Performed large-scale DNA sequence alignment of 100GB dataset on Rutgers University's Amarel High-Performance Computing cluster, leveraging parallel processing capabilities and optimized bioinformatics software environment.
* Set up lab space for new start-up, including ordering equipment and supplies, organizing inventory system to track materials, and developing protocols and workflows to ensure smooth lab operations.
* Analyze large genomic datasets from mouse models to identify marker genes and pathways involved in motor neurons development. Used statistical programs such as R/Python to process raw bulk RNA sequencing data.
* Manage mouse colony, handling breeding, weaning, genotyping to support ongoing research studies. Performed DNA extraction and PCR-based genotyping.

#### Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Senior Research Tech, 2023/05 - 2023/09) 

* Successfully managed a mouse colony of over 150 cages, conducted genotyping experiments with 40 to 80 samples with 10 different types of genes on a weekly basis.
* Effectively cultivated trust among cross-functional departments and other lab teams, result in a substantial increase in cooperation rates and a 50% reduction in waiting times.
* Executed job responsibilities in strict adherence to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards, holding a valid certification in GLP compliance.
* Swiftly assumed responsibility upon the departure of the previous senior tech, and efficiently mastered the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to ensure seamless maintenance of lab operations.


#### New York University, Grossman School of Medicine (Research Assistant, 2022/05 - 2023/05)

* Conducted image analysis and quantification using Tracker and EthoVision software to assess the effects of Vincristine on larval zebrafish lateral-line and other physiological responses.
* Boosted experimental efficiency by 25% through the implementation of meticulous protocols and comprehensive documentation of data for newly designed experiments.
* Proficiently synthesize research findings into comprehensive reports and craft compelling presentations to effectively communicate the research outcomes during oral presentations.
